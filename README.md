A widget of a map containing clickable pins that open informative panels about
natural disasters. Each panel has a question that prompts the user to think about
what kind of features are used to combat that specific disaster. 

I built this widget for HelloworldCS, a computer science curriculum platform that
partners with schools to teach kids how to program. This was made specifically for their
Earth Day IQ.
